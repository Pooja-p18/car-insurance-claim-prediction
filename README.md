# 🚗 Car Insurance Claim Prediction System

A machine learning–powered web application that predicts the **probability of an insurance claim** based on customer, vehicle, location, and safety-related features. The project demonstrates an **end‑to‑end ML workflow** — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using **Streamlit**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Insurance companies need to accurately assess risk to price policies and manage claims efficiently. This application helps estimate the **likelihood of a car insurance claim** for a given customer profile through a **complete machine‑learning system** that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. While a **Random Forest classifier** is used as the final predictive model, the core focus of the project is building a **reliable, end‑to‑end prediction system**, not just training a single algorithm.

### Key Highlights

* End‑to‑end ML pipeline (EDA → training → evaluation → deployment)
* Handles **class imbalance** using `class_weight="balanced"`
* Interactive **Streamlit** web interface
* Supports **single prediction** (and optional batch prediction)
* Clean, modular, and portfolio‑ready structure

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning & System Design Details

* **Model (Final Estimator)**: LightGBM
* **Pipeline Components**: Data preprocessing, feature alignment, model inference, probability calibration, and UI‑level validation
* **Problem Type**: Binary Classification (Claim / No Claim)
* **Evaluation Metric**: ROC‑AUC (primary), Precision, Recall
* **Class Imbalance Handling**: `class_weight='balanced'`

### Hyperparameter Tuning Note

Full `GridSearchCV` was attempted; however, due to **system memory constraints on Windows**, large parallel grid search runs were limited. Final hyperparameters were selected using **partial tuning and validation performance**, which is a common real‑world ML engineering trade‑off.
