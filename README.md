# 🚗 Car Insurance Claim Prediction System

A machine learning–powered web application that predicts the **probability of an insurance claim** based on customer, vehicle, location, and safety-related features. The project demonstrates an **end‑to‑end ML workflow** — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using **Streamlit**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Insurance companies need to accurately assess risk to price policies and manage claims efficiently. This application helps estimate the **likelihood of a car insurance claim** for a given customer profile through a **complete machine‑learning system** that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. While a **Random Forest classifier** is used as the final predictive model, the core focus of the project is building a **reliable, end‑to‑end prediction system**, not just training a single algorithm.

### Key Highlights

* End‑to‑end ML pipeline (EDA → training → evaluation → deployment)
* Handles **class imbalance** using 
  - :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
  - Class-weighted models (LightGBM, XGBoost)
* Interactive **Streamlit** web interface
* Supports **single prediction** (and optional batch prediction)
* Clean, modular, and portfolio‑ready structure

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning & System Design Details

* **Model (Final Estimator)**: LightGBM
* **Pipeline Components**: Data preprocessing, feature alignment, model inference, probability calibration, and UI‑level validation
* **Problem Type**: Binary Classification (Claim / No Claim)
* **Evaluation Metric**: ROC‑AUC (primary), Precision, Recall
* **Class Imbalance Handling**: `class_weight='balanced'`

### Hyperparameter Tuning Note

Full `GridSearchCV` was attempted; however, due to **system memory constraints on Windows**, large parallel grid search runs were limited. Final hyperparameters were selected using **partial tuning and validation performance**, which is a common real‑world ML engineering trade‑off.

## 📊 Model Performance
Best Model: LightGBM

- Recall: ~61%
- Precision: ~9.5%
- F1-Score: ~0.16
- ROC-AUC: ~0.65

The model prioritizes recall to capture more claim cases, which is critical in insurance risk prediction.

## 📊 Model Evaluation (Summary)

* The model is optimized for **recall to minimize missed claim cases**
* Due to class imbalance:
  - Higher recall ensures better detection of claims
  - Lower precision indicates more false positives (acceptable trade-off)
* This reflects a real-world business scenario where missing a claim is costlier than a false alert.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

* Class imbalance significantly affects model performance
* Accuracy is not a reliable metric for imbalanced datasets
* Recall and F1-score provide better evaluation
* LightGBM performed best among all models

---

## 🚀 Deployment

This application is deployment‑ready and can be hosted using:

* **Streamlit Community Cloud**
* Any cloud VM supporting Python

Before deployment:

* Ensure `requirements.txt` contains only required libraries
* Ensure model path is correct (`models/best_model.pkl`)

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Advanced feature engineering
* SHAP‑based model explainability
* Better hyperparameter tuning with higher‑resource environment
* User authentication
* API version (FastAPI)
